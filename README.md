# Naqwah – AI-powered Coffee Bean Quality Assessment App ☕

**Naqwah** is a mobile application that leverages **YOLOv8 object detection** to **automate the grading of coffee beans**.  
This project was developed as my **graduation project** for the **Computer Science program at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Manual inspection of coffee beans is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to inconsistencies.  
**Naqwah** solves this by offering an automated, AI-based solution that:

- Detects and counts 16 types of coffee bean defects + 1 "Good" category.
- Grades coffee quality based on **Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA)** standards.
- Generates an automatic PDF inspection report.
- Streamlines quality control with high accuracy and minimal human effort.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Figma** (UI/UX Design)  
- **Flutter** (Frontend)  
- **YOLOv8** (AI Model)  
- **FastAPI** (Backend)  
- **MySQL** (Database)  
- **Render & Railway** (Deployment)  

---

## 🧾 Features

- Upload image of coffee beans for real-time detection
- View total number of defects per image
- See assigned grade based on SFDA standards
- Automatically generated PDF report (excluding images)
- Fast, accurate, and consistent quality inspection
